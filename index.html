For the following two, you can simply take a 30 second pretend audio recording & video recording to use, we are just trying to get you familiar with the <audio> and <video> elements. Yes, you must have both audio and video elements, and yes, you can use the audio from the video you took for the audio element, it just has to be in a separate audio file.
